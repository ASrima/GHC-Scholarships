# GHC-Scholarships

Comprehensive list of student scholarships for [the Grace Hopper Celebration for
Women in Computing](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/) held every October. This list aims
to cover all relevant scholarships, even if they apply to specific sub-groups
(LGBTQ+, specific country, etc) to enable as many students to attend GHC as
possible!
